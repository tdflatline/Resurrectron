Quick steps:

0. Download nltk-2.08b and all its dependencies.
1. Use the harvest.py script to pull down a bunch of .jtwt files
2. Throw them in a directory
3. Edit extract.py main() to point it at the dir and write a soul file.
4. Run extract.py to generate a soul file and some random sentences.

This is still hackware. Resurect.py is broke in this commit.
